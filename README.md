An assignment by Matthew Kluk

With Collaborations from: 

* Mohamad Jamaleddine, who helped me understand how to go from a
 socket reading in a request to giving back an HTML response.

In addition, I used code and information from:

* https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html - for learning how to parse a URL into a host/port/scheme/etc.
* https://www.grc.com/port_443.htm - for remebering 443 is the secure HTML port.
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html - for learning how Python reads in to a data buffer. 
* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_requests.htm - for learning how to format an HTTP response.
